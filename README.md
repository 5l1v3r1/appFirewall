# AppFirewall

A free fully open-source application firewall for MAC OS Mojave and later.  Allows real-time monitoring of network connections being made by applications, and blocking/allowing of these per app by user.  Supports use of hostname lists (Energized Blu etc) to block known tracker and advertising domains for all apps.  Also allows blocking of all network connections for specified apps, blocking of all connections except for specified whitelisted connections, use of pre-configured lists of connections per app to allow/block etc.  

## Getting Started

Just drag the appFirewall icon into your Applications folder and click on it to start, there's nothing more to it.

## Privacy - What data we collect

The short answer is "none".  No personal data is shared by this app. 

If you refresh the hostname files (with lists of blacklisted domains) then the web site that hosts the file may log the request (and so your IP address etc).  Refresh of hostname files is manual only, i.e. only when you press the "Refresh Lists" button on the app preferences page, so you have complete control over this.
