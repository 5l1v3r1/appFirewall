# appFirewall Privacy Policy

##What data we collect

The short answer is "none". No personal data is shared by this app. Some local log files are generated by the app, in particular:

    ~/Library/Application Support/appFirewall/app_log.txt
    /Library/Logs/com.leith.appFirewall-Helper.log

but they remain on your own machine.

If you refresh the hostname files (with lists of blacklisted domains) then the web site that hosts the file may log the request (and so your IP address etc). Refresh of hostname files is manual only i.e. only when you press the "refresh" button on the app preferences page, so you have complete control over this.

If the app crashes (hopefully not !) then it will send a short backtrace to http://leith.ie to help with debugging. There is no personal information in this backtrace, an example is the following:

    0 appFirewall 0x000000010dc3ae1e appFirewall 73246
    1 libsystem_platform.dylib 0x00007fff769b5b5d _sigtramp 29
    2 ??? 0x000000011d3f8b76 0x0 4785671030
    3 libsystem_c.dylib 0x00007fff76822d8a raise 26
    4 appFirewall 0x000000010dc4fab5 appFirewall 158389
    5 appFirewall 0x000000010dc5001b appFirewall 159771

(its a list of entry points in the app so that I can see where it crashed, nothing more). The http://leith.ie web server does not log IP address or other connection details.
