TO DO

short term:
- exit vs terminate.  zombie processes. restarted process seeing old one

longer term:
1. use of network extensions, only for catalina onwards though.  this should allow fine-grained blocking of QUIC traffic and filtering of local mDNS and uPNP broadcast traffic.
2. add socks interface that is filtered.  can be interposed between ssh tunnel etc.
3. explore resetting of quic connections e.g. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.1
