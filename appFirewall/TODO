TO DO

short term:
- check operation with SIPS enabled, will fall back to not using dtrace
- distribute baseline dns_conn_cache (covering apple apps etc) with app

longer term:
- try use of network extensions - avoid tcp RSTs on new connections ?  only for cataline onwards though
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- compress log samples uploaded to server?
- UI remove dock item, but need to create menu when open window from status bar.  main problem is how to let user control statusbar vs dock -- another pref pane just for this ?
