TO DO

short term:

longer term:
1. allow addition of user specified host name lists
2. QUIC: (i) add UDP/QUIC blocking via pf and/or via DNS ? (ii) resetting of quic connections ? https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.1 (iii) network extensions (catalina)
3. add option to log and filter local mDNS broadcast traffic
4. add DNS proxy.  support for DNS over HTTPS and can use  pktap to infer app making a DNS request so can do app-based blocking  at DNS level e.g. of UDP
(lo0, proc mDNSResponder:238, eproc MATLAB:36138, svc CTL, out, so) IP localhost.53108 > localhost.domain: 27827+ A? services.mathworks.com. (40)
5. add socks interface that is filtered.  can be interposed between ssh tunnel etc.
6. use of network extensions, only for catalina onwards though
7. compress log samples uploaded to server?
