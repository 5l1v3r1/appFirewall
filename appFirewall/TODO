TO DO

short term:
- VPN testing.  does catcher go crazy with vpn? no route to host etc

longer term:
- use of network extensions, only for catalina onwards though
- sandbox currently prevents calls to proc_info.  until that's fixed we can't run app inside sandbox
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- compress log samples uploaded to server?
