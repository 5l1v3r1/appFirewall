TO DO

short term:
- try use of network extensions - avoid tcp RSTs on new connections ?  need developer id first though
- add screenshots to readme ?
- check operation with SIPS enabled, will fall back to not using dtrace
- UI remove dock item, but need to create menu when open window from status bar

longer term:
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- add export/upload to server of sanitised (no firefox, chrome, safari etc) log files


error-popup - option to reinstall helper, when appropriate
sniffer guessing - add confidence.
for escapees, go back and update log
