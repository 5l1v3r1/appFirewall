// TO DO:
// resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
// sending of RST to existing connections i.e. not just on SYN-ACK.  that way can recover from missing the SYN-ACK
// add filtering to log window e.g. to just show non-blocked connections or connections
// from a particular app
