TO DO

short term:
- update baseline dns_conn_cache
- helper: filter out DNS queries and truncated pkts - reduce "noise"
- pin selected row in UI

longer term:
- use of network extensions, only for cataline onwards though
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- compress log samples uploaded to server?
- UI remove dock item, but need to create menu when open window from status bar.  main problem is how to let user control statusbar vs dock -- another pref pane just for this ?
- handle multiple domains sharing same IP, in first instance using dtrace to catch calls to mDNSResponder.
- support for multiple active interfaces (need to fire up a separate pcap sniffer thread for each)
