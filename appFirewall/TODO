TO DO

short term:
- when dns over https is implemented within an application (i.e. firefox, chrome) then its not sent in the clear over the loopback interface.  not sure how to resolve addresses in this case

longer term:
- use of network extensions, only for catalina onwards though
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- compress log samples uploaded to server?
- add socks interface that is filtered.  can be interposed between ssh tunnel etc.
