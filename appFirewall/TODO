TO DO

short term:
- update baseline dns_conn_cache
- append_dns: log when multiple domains share same IP

longer term:
- try use of network extensions - avoid tcp RSTs on new connections ?  only for cataline onwards though
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- compress log samples uploaded to server?
- UI remove dock item, but need to create menu when open window from status bar.  main problem is how to let user control statusbar vs dock -- another pref pane just for this ?
