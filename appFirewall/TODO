TO DO

short term:

longer term:
1. allow addition of user specified host name lists
2. resetting of quic connections e.g. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.1
3. add option to log and filter local mDNS broadcast traffic
4. add DNS proxy.  support for DNS over HTTPS and can use  pktap to infer app making a DNS request so can do app-based blocking  at DNS level e.g. of QUIC and UDP
(lo0, proc mDNSResponder:238, eproc MATLAB:36138, svc CTL, out, so) IP localhost.53108 > localhost.domain: 27827+ A? services.mathworks.com. (40)
5. add socks interface that is filtered.  can be interposed between ssh tunnel etc.
6. use of network extensions, only for catalina onwards though
7. compress log samples uploaded to server?
