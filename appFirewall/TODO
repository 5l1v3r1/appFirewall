TO DO

short term:

longer term:
- use of network extensions, only for cataline onwards though
- sandbox currently prevents calls to proc_info.  until that's fixed we can't run app inside sandbox
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- support for multiple active interfaces (need to fire up a separate pcap sniffer thread for each)
- compress log samples uploaded to server?
- add unit tests !
