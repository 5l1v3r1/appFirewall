TO DO

short term:
- should dtrace be off by default ?  enabled via a pref setting? use of syn to lookup PIDinfo -- might allow dtrace to be avoided ?
- try use of network extensions - avoid tcp RSTs on new connections ?  need developer id first though
- add screenshots to readme ?
- change dtrace to use libdtrace and fetch from buffers on syn (or syn-ack)

longer term:
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- add export/upload to server of sanitised (no firefox, chrome, safari etc) log files
