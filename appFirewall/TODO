TO DO

short term:
- allow addition of user specified host name lists
- add UDP/QUIC blocking via pf ?

longer term:
- add option to log and filter local mDNS broadcast traffic
- add DNS proxy.  support for DNS over HTTPS and can use  pktap to infer app making a DNS request so can do app-based blocking  at DNS level e.g. of UDP
(lo0, proc mDNSResponder:238, eproc MATLAB:36138, svc CTL, out, so) IP localhost.53108 > localhost.domain: 27827+ A? services.mathworks.com. (40)
- add socks interface that is filtered.  can be interposed between ssh tunnel etc.
- use of network extensions, only for catalina onwards though
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- compress log samples uploaded to server?
