TO DO

short term:
- try use of network extensions - avoid tcp RSTs on new connections ?  need developer id first though
- add screenshots to readme ?

longer term:
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- add export/upload to server of sanitised (no firefox, chrome, safari etc) log files

when get a pid miss, can we guess using the dns lookup ?
