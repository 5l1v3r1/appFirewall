TO DO

short term:
- option to listen on loopback interface -- ssh tunnels, dns over https

longer term:
- use of network extensions, only for catalina onwards though
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- compress log samples uploaded to server?
- add socks interface that is filtered.  can be interposed between ssh tunnel etc.
- is it possible to handle IPv6 tunnels in snd_rst_toself() ?
