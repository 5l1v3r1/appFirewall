TO DO

short term:
- automated app updates (no need to manually copy from github)
- allow to check for updates automatically (user pref)
- start up on login (user pref)
- helper doesn't start if no interface when installed, needs to install and wait

longer term:
- use of network extensions, only for catalina onwards though
- sandbox currently prevents calls to proc_info.  until that's fixed we can't run app inside sandbox
- resetting of quic connections.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport-22#section-19.19
- support for multiple active interfaces (need to fire up a separate pcap sniffer thread for each)
- compress log samples uploaded to server?
